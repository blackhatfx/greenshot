tags: []

Hi, I would like to set 2 buttons on my mouse
      1st for Print screen to Clipboard
  The 2nd for Print Screen to Paint

I can not seperate these features with 1 instance of greenshot, so i would like to intall 2 that run simultaneously, with different settings and mouse button shortcuts.

If someone can advise on this, it would be much appriciated,

Thank you,
